    <h1>EternalOn - Clean Power</h1>

    <img src="images/workbench.jpg">

    <p>EternalOn stands for "eternally on". Batteries die. Nuclear reactors have to shut down to refuel. Cars suck gas. Electric vehicles have limited range. 
        Solar panels sleep at night. Some of these technologies are more environmentally friendly than others. IEternalOn is pioneering 
        the way for this technology to exist. Take a look at some of our work and consider partnering with us to further
        these exciting developments.

    <h3>Project: Flash</h3>

    <p>Flash takes in a DC input set to a constant current, and distributes this around the various coils in the core 
        using "velocity gates" controlled by an FPGA. By varying the pattern and speed of the current, the power output of this device
    can be manipulated and higher efficiences can be gained.

    <h2>About the Founder</h2>

    <p>Graham Gunderson has been obsessed with electronics ever since he was a little kid.
        Graham has worked in the electronics industry several decades with part of his career spent building and debunking various
        inventions that claimed to generate more power than they consumed. During his time there he developed a fascination with magnetic circuits
        and found several ideas that could not be disproved and he has spend much of his time fine tuning and perfecting what he discovered.
